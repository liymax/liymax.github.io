3. Have a good understanding and skilled use of es6 and css3, and have extensive knowledge and deep accumulation in front-end technology

### Technical preference
In terms of js framework, I have a good understanding and mastery of vue and react, and also have a preliminary understanding and strong interest in svelte.

I also have rich experience in chart development. Due to my personal love for D3 and continuous learning and use, I have a deep understanding of it and can use it to develop highly customized charts.

Of course, it is not only limited to the front end. I have also developed a great interest in the server-side language golang, and I have actively studied it. I have a preliminary grasp of it and can write some simple applications.

Don't want to be too verbose, the above are just what I think are worth mentioning

## Final special note

As you know, I have been in a Chinese environment for a long time, my English level is very limited, and I do not have the listening and speaking ability to communicate with people normally. As for the ability to read and write, it's okay to use translation software. Therefore, if you want to interview, you can only have an interviewer who speaks Chinese. If you can gain your trust, it may bring you a surprise.
